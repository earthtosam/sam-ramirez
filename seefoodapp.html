                <p>This highlights a significant underlying issue, suggesting that either users are not finding what they need and consequently leave, or they are not engaging with the menu page at all. The latter scenario is particularly concerning and has the potential to inflict the most damage on our platform.
                <br>
                <br>
                According to a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/145949/luring-restaurant-customers-back.aspx" target="_blank">Gallup report</a>, customers typically spend an average of 109 seconds reading a physical menu.

                <h2>Restaurants utilize separate services to have an online menu and showcase their business. Why not do that in one place?</h2>
                <p>In the course of my research, it became glaringly apparent that the prevailing industry landscape was marked by a compartmentalized approach. Many existing services and platforms were tailored to deliver specific, albeit disjointed, solutions to businesses. For instance, one service might handle online menu management, while another focused on customer reviews and yet another on social media promotion. While each service served its purpose, this disjointed strategy inevitably led to several critical issues:<br>
                <br>
                <b>1. Higher Costs:</b> Maintaining subscriptions or contracts with multiple service providers not only added up to significant recurring costs but also required businesses to invest extra time and effort in managing various relationships.<br>
                <br>
                <b>2. Fragmented Online Presence:</b> When businesses opted for this segmented approach, their digital identity became fractured across multiple platforms. This made it challenging for potential customers to discover and engage with them online seamlessly.<br>
                <br>
                <b>3. User Confusion:</b> Users were often left bewildered, having to navigate a maze of different apps or websites to interact with their preferred restaurants. This complexity discouraged user engagement and could potentially drive them to competitors who offered a more unified and user-friendly experience.<br>
                <br>
                Given these pressing issues, it became increasingly evident that there was a clear opportunity to provide restaurants with an integrated platform like Seefood, which not only simplifies their online presence but also reduces costs, fosters brand consistency, and ultimately enhances the overall user experience.

At this point in time, we were also in the middle of developing our own CMS to make it easier for restaurants to edit their platform page. But this came in conflict to what I was presenting, since the CMS only allowed the basic information to be changed.
                <br>
                <br>
                It was clear that the CMS too would have to be redrawn later down the line to meet the challenges we’ve been facing.</p>

        <div class="section-details">
            <div class="details">
                <h2>Some elements of the SeeFood brand were already predefined. But this was a chance to elevate the purpose behind the design.</h2>
                <p>However, this presented a valuable opportunity to not only uphold the existing brand essence but also to elevate its purpose through thoughtful design choices.<br>
                <br>
                <b>1. Color Palette: Elevating the Essence</b> The cornerstone of this design evolution began with a careful consideration of color. It was imperative to maintain brand consistency, and the vibrant 'SeeFood Red' (#F54F55) served as a pivotal accent color that resonated with users. To create a harmonious visual experience, we complemented this vibrant red with subtle shades of white and black, allowing the user interface to breathe and ensuring content clarity. This careful balance of colors created a fresh and inviting environment for users to explore.<br>
                <br>
                <b>2. Typography: Playful Yet Readable</b> Typography played a crucial role in setting the tone for the Seefood brand. It was imperative to strike a balance between invoking a playful and approachable atmosphere while maintaining clean, legible text for ease of use. Through meticulous font selection, I achieved a nice blend, ensuring that the typography mirrored the brand's personality.<br>
                <br>
                <b>3. Component Design: Fostering User-Friendly Interactions</b> Every component of the user interface was meticulously designed with the user's needs in mind. To enhance the overall user experience, we applied consistent principles across all components, including uniform border radius adjustments. By replacing traditional box shadows with a subtle gray border that complemented the background's gray tint, we created a more user-friendly and modern design aesthetic. This small yet significant change served to emphasize the content and interactions, offering a more intuitive and visually pleasing experience for Seefood users.<br>
                <br>
                In essence, this design process aimed not only to maintain Seefood's established brand identity but to enrich its purpose. By incorporating these thoughtful design elements, I sought out to elevate the overall user experience, ensuring that Seefood's design language would not only be functional, but a delight to engage with.

                <p>I spoke with the team about the needed changes and proposed the necessary advancements to stay competitive and bring more users to the platform. Once the changes are made, we’ll be monitoring daily users, how Events and Offers are received by users, and if there’s growth in our retention rate.</p>

                <h2>I was very grateful for the opportunity afforded for me from the SeeFood team, and their shared commitment to improving the platform over the years. This project was a culmination of, not just the past few weeks, but everything I’ve worked on. Looking back on this project, my biggest learning moments were:</h2>
                <br>
                <p><span>Get the right insight from research</span>. After a few weeks of research and development, it’s easy to get lost and drift from the objective. I insisted on having a larger dish image to showcase a restaurant, since it would be more engaging for the user and highlight a restaurant’s offerings. But this slows down exploration, the proportions aren’t conventional to what a restaurant already displays, and the image ultimately isn’t the last deciding factor. So although I was right, they didn’t coincide with the end goal for this redesign.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span>Ideate as much from the get-go</span>. There were a lot of iterations that I went through the project. Three to be exact. And every time I went through another cycle, it was because I delved deeper into the design, and saw an opportunity to improve on it. More importantly, I was able to get a better understanding of why certain designs work more effectively than others. This will save me some time in the future, and gives me a better sense to obey WCAG standards.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span>Perfect is the enemy of good</span>. There’s always an opportunity to improve, but I learned through those various iterations that it’s important to get through those choices during ideation. It saves time, and puts more hours spent on a design that’ll see the light of day. So as much as my mind likes to wander to a design shift, I ask myself if that’s necessary, if that’s going to cut into the delivery window, and if it’s something that conflicts with the project goal.
