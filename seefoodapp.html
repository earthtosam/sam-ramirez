                <h2>Navigating the Post-Pandemic Landscape</h2>
                <p>Seefood is facing a shifting landscape in the wake of the pandemic. While it experienced meteoric growth during the height of the crisis, the company now finds itself at a crossroads, dealing with the challenges of maintaining user engagement and nurturing restaurant partnerships.<br>
                <br>
                During the pandemic's peak, Seefood surged in popularity as consumers sought safe and convenient alternatives to in-person dining. However, the tides have turned. As the restaurant industry begins to embrace the return of traditional dining experiences, Seefood now occupies a unique position in the market—a luxury choice for discerning users and a perceived added expense for restaurant owners, especially when compared to the convenience of established online delivery services.</p>

                <h2>As part of the web development team, the issues plaguing SeeFood were very clear.</h2>
                <p>Over the course of several months, our growth trajectory had taken a noticeable downturn. Numerous brainstorming sessions were held in an attempt to diagnose and rectify our issues. While these meetings generated a slew of new feature ideas and strategies to win over restaurants, it was clear that our focus was askew. The problem was a user issue.
                <br>
                <br>
                Recognizing this pivotal point, I stepped forward and offered to conduct a comprehensive analysis. My goal was to meticulously dissect the issues, present them to the team, and come up with a solution to pick ourselves up.</p>

                <h2>An average session on SeeFood last 12 seconds.</h2>
                <p>This highlights a significant underlying issue, suggesting that either users are not finding what they need and consequently leave, or they are not engaging with the menu page at all. The latter scenario is particularly concerning and has the potential to inflict the most damage on our platform.
                <br>
                <br>
                According to a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/145949/luring-restaurant-customers-back.aspx" target="_blank">Gallup report</a>, customers typically spend an average of 109 seconds reading a physical menu. Drawing this comparison underscores the imperative for a digital menu to replicate the same level of engagement as its physical counterpart.</p>

                <h2>93% of people view menus online before dining out.</h2>
                <p>Research conducted by <a href="https://restaurant.opentable.com/resources/holiday-marketing/#:~:text=An%20OpenTable%20survey%20concluded%20that,a%20specific%20place%20in%20mind." target="_blank">OpenTable</a> reveals that modern customers are thorough in their pre-ordering investigations, considering factors like pricing, menu choices, restaurant location, special offerings, and dietary accommodations. These aspects significantly influence their dining decisions.
                <br>
                <br>
                Furthermore, as reported by <a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/how-instagram-changed-the-restaurant-industry-infographic/572565/" target="_blank">SocialMediaToday</a>, an impressive 30% of millennial diners actively steer clear of restaurants with a lackluster presence on Instagram.

        <h1><span>Competitive Analysis</span></h1>

        <div class="section-details">
            <div class="details">
                <h2>SeeFood isn’t a delivery service. But competes in the same space.</h2>
                <p>In today's digital age, businesses must allocate their efforts strategically, and users have their go-to apps for discovering their next dining experience. In light of this competitive landscape, I delved into research that unveiled a significant trend: most restaurants provide the essential information required for placing delivery orders through various platforms. However, what sets successful establishments apart is their ability to convey their unique personality and distinguish themselves from the crowded marketplace of competitors.
                <br>
                <br>
                Upon closer examination, it became evident that many restaurants rely heavily on social media platforms as a means to foster awareness and establish their distinct identity. These platforms offer the ideal canvas for showcasing the personality, ambiance, and specialties that set them apart. By leveraging the visual and interactive nature of social media, restaurants can not only attract new customers but also foster loyalty and engagement among their existing customers, creating a compelling reason for users to choose them over other dining options.</p>

                <h2>I conducted 34 interviews with business owners and users.</h2>
                <p>In light of finding out that most SeeFood partners also had multiple online delivery services, it was worth looking into their services. Although SeeFood isn’t a delivery service, we compete for the business solution. These services are all automated, which can be seen as a good thing for restaurants that value their time. But it can also be problematic, leaving them out in the dark and handing over control to a third party. And on top of that, the order fee digs deep to their already razor-thin profit margins.
                <br>
                <br>
                I also conducted user research to get a better grasp at user objectives, priorities, and fluency. Since SeeFood would work towards delivering an enhanced experience to a  diverse user base, it was important to understand how a digital experience could compete with a traditional physical menu. And if restaurant owners still saw any value in it.</p>

        <div class="section-details">
            <div class="details">
                <h2>Restaurants utilize separate services to have an online menu and showcase their business. Why not do that in one place?</h2>
                <p>In the course of my research, it became glaringly apparent that the prevailing industry landscape was marked by a compartmentalized approach. Many existing services and platforms were tailored to deliver specific, albeit disjointed, solutions to businesses. For instance, one service might handle online menu management, while another focused on customer reviews and yet another on social media promotion. While each service served its purpose, this disjointed strategy inevitably led to several critical issues:<br>
                <br>
                <b>1. Higher Costs:</b> Maintaining subscriptions or contracts with multiple service providers not only added up to significant recurring costs but also required businesses to invest extra time and effort in managing various relationships.<br>
                <br>
                <b>2. Fragmented Online Presence:</b> When businesses opted for this segmented approach, their digital identity became fractured across multiple platforms. This made it challenging for potential customers to discover and engage with them online seamlessly.<br>
                <br>
                <b>3. User Confusion:</b> Users were often left bewildered, having to navigate a maze of different apps or websites to interact with their preferred restaurants. This complexity discouraged user engagement and could potentially drive them to competitors who offered a more unified and user-friendly experience.<br>
                <br>
                Given these pressing issues, it became increasingly evident that there was a clear opportunity to provide restaurants with an integrated platform like Seefood, which not only simplifies their online presence but also reduces costs, fosters brand consistency, and ultimately enhances the overall user experience.

                <h2>Early in the stages of ideation, I quickly saw the potential of AR content. But the idea was short lived.</h2>
                <p>The idea of showcasing a menu in AR made complete sense to the goal of SeeFood. This would be the next step of 2D content, and give users a clear understanding and a unique experience to interact with the menu.<br>
                <br>
                However, to make this possible, we would need the cooperation of restaurants to provide 3D content, which we already learned from our research that it’s extremely difficult to have businesses on board with providing images. We would also need to make sure development would have enough time to build backend support for it, which would extend our launch window. The idea has potential, and could be the next step for the platform.

                <p>I regrouped with everyone to present my findings, how our competition goes beyond what we initially thought, and how we fair against them. At this point in time, we were also in the middle of developing our own CMS to make it easier for restaurants to edit their platform page. But this came in conflict to what I was presenting, since the CMS only allowed the basic information to be changed.
                <br>
                <br>
                It was clear that the CMS too would have to be redrawn later down the line to meet the challenges we’ve been facing.</p>

        <h1><span>Defining a Design Language</span></h1>

        <div class="section-details">
            <div class="details">
                <h2>Some elements of the SeeFood brand were already predefined. But this was a chance to elevate the purpose behind the design.</h2>
                <p>However, this presented a valuable opportunity to not only uphold the existing brand essence but also to elevate its purpose through thoughtful design choices.<br>
                <br>
                <b>1. Color Palette: Elevating the Essence</b> The cornerstone of this design evolution began with a careful consideration of color. It was imperative to maintain brand consistency, and the vibrant 'SeeFood Red' (#F54F55) served as a pivotal accent color that resonated with users. To create a harmonious visual experience, we complemented this vibrant red with subtle shades of white and black, allowing the user interface to breathe and ensuring content clarity. This careful balance of colors created a fresh and inviting environment for users to explore.<br>
                <br>
                <b>2. Typography: Playful Yet Readable</b> Typography played a crucial role in setting the tone for the Seefood brand. It was imperative to strike a balance between invoking a playful and approachable atmosphere while maintaining clean, legible text for ease of use. Through meticulous font selection, I achieved a nice blend, ensuring that the typography mirrored the brand's personality.<br>
                <br>
                <b>3. Component Design: Fostering User-Friendly Interactions</b> Every component of the user interface was meticulously designed with the user's needs in mind. To enhance the overall user experience, we applied consistent principles across all components, including uniform border radius adjustments. By replacing traditional box shadows with a subtle gray border that complemented the background's gray tint, we created a more user-friendly and modern design aesthetic. This small yet significant change served to emphasize the content and interactions, offering a more intuitive and visually pleasing experience for Seefood users.<br>
                <br>
                In essence, this design process aimed not only to maintain Seefood's established brand identity but to enrich its purpose. By incorporating these thoughtful design elements, I sought out to elevate the overall user experience, ensuring that Seefood's design language would not only be functional, but a delight to engage with.

                <h2>A new way for users to explore.</h2>
                <p>Providing these diverse options served as a means to offer users a vivid preview of what awaits them. In today's digital age, diners frequently turn to online research to shape their dining experiences, whether they seek a romantic dinner setting or a lively, music-filled atmosphere. It became evident that this multifaceted approach had myriad applications. First, it catered to users who may not have a specific experience in mind, helping them discover a dining setting that aligns with their preferences. Simultaneously, it offered an avenue for restaurants to showcase themselves in a captivating manner, effectively promoting their unique offerings to a receptive audience of potential patrons.</p>

                <h2>A careful look at what to expect.</h2>
                <p>I spoke with the team about the needed changes and proposed the necessary advancements to stay competitive and bring more users to the platform. Once the changes are made, we’ll be monitoring daily users, how Events and Offers are received by users, and if there’s growth in our retention rate (Users explore the platform more than previous iteration). We’ll also be pushing our curated features to new and current SeeFood partners to garner excitement from businesses.</p>

                <h2>I was very grateful for the opportunity afforded for me from the SeeFood team, and their shared commitment to improving the platform over the years. This project was a culmination of, not just the past few weeks, but everything I’ve worked on. Looking back on this project, my biggest learning moments were:</h2>
                <br>
                <p><span>Get the right insight from research</span>. After a few weeks of research and development, it’s easy to get lost and drift from the objective. I insisted on having a larger dish image to showcase a restaurant, since it would be more engaging for the user and highlight a restaurant’s offerings. But this slows down exploration, the proportions aren’t conventional to what a restaurant already displays, and the image ultimately isn’t the last deciding factor. So although I was right, they didn’t coincide with the end goal for this redesign.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span>Ideate as much from the get-go</span>. There were a lot of iterations that I went through the project. Three to be exact. And every time I went through another cycle, it was because I delved deeper into the design, and saw an opportunity to improve on it. More importantly, I was able to get a better understanding of why certain designs work more effectively than others. This will save me some time in the future, and gives me a better sense to obey WCAG standards.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span>Perfect is the enemy of good</span>. There’s always an opportunity to improve, but I learned through those various iterations that it’s important to get through those choices during ideation. It saves time, and puts more hours spent on a design that’ll see the light of day. So as much as my mind likes to wander to a design shift, I ask myself if that’s necessary, if that’s going to cut into the delivery window, and if it’s something that conflicts with the project goal.
