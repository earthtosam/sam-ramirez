                <p>For months, our growth was declining. We had multiple meetings trying to come up with a solution to our problem, mostly coming up with more feature ideas and ways to gain favor with restaurants. But the problem lied on our focus. It was a user issue.
                <br>
                <br>
                That’s when I initially offered to take a deeper dive into our problem, lay them out for the team, and come up with a solution to pick ourselves up.</p>

                <h2><span>93% of people view menus</span> online before dining out.</h2>
                <p>According to research by OpenTable, customers look into more information before ordering out such as pricing, food options, location, offerings, and dietary restrictions to influence their decision. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Additionally, according to Social Media Today, 30% of millennial diners actively avoid restaurants with a weak Instagram presence. Not only are delivery services a competitor, but so are social media platforms that allow businesses more flexibility to present themselves and bring awareness to their business.</p>

            <div class="details">
                <h2>SeeFood <span>isn’t a delivery service</span>. But competes for the same service.</h2>
                <p>Businesses can only focus their efforts on a few number of platforms, and users already have apps they use to search their next meal.
                <br>
                <br>
                Upon research, I found that most restaurants provide the basic information needed for delivery orders. But there’s no personality on those pages to differentiate themselves from the rest of their competitors. For that, they rely on social media platforms to drive awareness.</p>

                <h2>I conducted <span>34 interviews</span> with business owners and users.</h2>
                <p>In light of finding out that most SeeFood partners also had multiple online delivery services, it was worth looking into their services. Although SeeFood isn’t a delivery service, we compete for the business solution. These services are all automated, which can be seen as a good thing for restaurants that value their time. But it can also be problematic, leaving them out in the dark and handing over control to a third party. And on top of that, the order fee digs deep to their already razor-thin profit margins.
                <br>
                <br>
                I also conducted user research to get a better grasp at user objectives, priorities, and fluency. Since SeeFood would work towards delivering an enhanced experience to a  diverse user base, it was important to understand how a digital experience could compete with a traditional physical menu. And if restaurant owners still saw any value in it.</p>

                <p>Throughout my research, it was clear that every other service or platform put their focus on delivering a specific service to a business. This added to a higher cost to the business and a fragmented online presence that’s harder to find for the user.</p>

                <p>I regrouped with everyone to present my findings, how our competition goes beyond what we initially thought, and how we fair against them. At this point in time, we were also in the middle of developing our own CMS to make it easier for restaurants to edit their platform page. But this came in conflict to what I was presenting, since the CMS only allowed the basic information to be changed.
                <br>
                <br>
                It was clear that the CMS too would have to be redrawn later down the line to meet the challenges we’ve been facing.</p>

                <p>It’s clear that users account for multiple factors when looking for the next place to dine at. With that in mind, it was equally important to provide users with those options from the start. Whether it’d be something local, a cuisine type, dietary restrictions, a place with music, a bar you’d feel comfortable drinking at, or a special offer that’s hard to refuse, all those options are accounted for while not overwhelming the user.</p>

                <p>From the start, I knew the main homepage would have to get change drastically. Previously, the homepage showed the list of restaurants, with the showcase image being a picture of the business. And while this gives context to the user of the restaurant setting, that’s not enough to entice the user between one restaurant from another. Replacing that image with the top dishes gives better insight into what the user is looking for.</p>

                <p>The restaurant page has so much to deliver, so every piece of information has to be purposeful. Otherwise, it can get very crowded really quick. So the most crucial information has to be presented here, with additional information being easily accessible for users.</p>

                <p>Keeping the dimensions the same as other social media platforms was intentional. Not only does it make it easier for businesses to provide menu images, but makes the platform familiar for users. Secondary information helps give a deeper understanding of what users value, with nutritional information, and dietary restrictions.</p>

Customers like to research online before dining out because they’re looking for a specific experience. Whether that’s a romantic dinner, or place filled with music.

        <h1>Retrospective</h1>

        <div class="section-details">
            <div class="details">
                <h2>I was eternally grateful for the opportunity afforded for me from the SeeFood team, and their shared commitment to improving the platform over the years. This project was a culmination of, not just the past few weeks, but everything I’ve worked on. Looking back on this project, my biggest learning moments were:</h2>
                <p><span>Get the right insight from research</span>. After a few weeks of research and development, it’s easy to get lost and drift from the objective. I insisted on having a larger dish image to showcase a restaurant, since it would be more engaging for the user and highlight a restaurant’s offerings. But this slows down exploration, the proportions aren’t conventional to what a restaurant already displays, and the image ultimately isn’t the last deciding factor. So although I was right, they didn’t coincide with the end goal for this redesign.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span>Ideate as much from the get-go</span>. There were a lot of iterations that I went through the project. Three to be exact. And every time I went through another cycle, it was because I delved deeper into the design, and saw an opportunity to improve on it. More importantly, I was able to get a better understanding of why certain designs work more effectively than others. This will save me some time in the future, and gives me a better sense to obey WCAG standards.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span>Perfect is the enemy of good</span>. There’s always an opportunity to improve, but I learned through those various iterations that it’s important to get through those choices during ideation. It saves time, and puts more hours spent on a design that’ll see the light of day. So as much as my mind likes to wander to a design shift, I ask myself if that’s necessary, if that’s going to cut into the delivery window, and if it’s something that conflicts with the project goal.
